FTensor requires a C++14 conformant compiler.  It is tested with GCC
6.3.0 and Clang 3.8.

There are no libraries to build.  In principle, FTensor can be used
directly from a checkout.  There is a build script in 'wscript'.  It
uses waf to build tests and install headers.  Waf should be included
with the repository.  For example,

  ./waf configure --prefix=/path/to/install
  ./waf

will build (but not run) the conformance tests.  You can run the tests
with the command

  ./build/conformance

Running

  ./waf install

will install the headers in /path/to/install/include.  You can see all
of the possible options to configure by running

  ./waf configure --help
